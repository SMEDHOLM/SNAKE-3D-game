I did not find any solution for controlling camera, because there is no material for scala.
I have no ideas for minimap realization.
To add multiplayer I need to rewrite half of code.
I want to return Snake 3D on moderate level because there is too much to do for level difficulty and I cannot find any useful materials for scala. I have two more projects to do.
For some reason food spawns on walls or Snake even if there method that check those collisions.
